    "# Creating a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System with LangChain and Mistral\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! This notebook demonstrates how to build a RAG system using [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/) and the [Mistral API](https://docs.mistral.ai/). \n",
    "\n",
    "**What is RAG?**\n",
    "- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique that combines information retrieval with language generation.\n",
    "- It allows LLMs to access and utilize external knowledge sources by retrieving relevant documents and using them to inform responses.\n",
    "- This enables more accurate, up-to-date, and contextually relevant answers beyond the model's training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook Goals:**\n",
    "- Show how to set up a RAG system powered by Mistral.\n",
    "- Demonstrate document loading, embedding, and retrieval.\n",
    "- Build a question-answering system that can answer questions based on your documents.\n",
    "- Align with the agentic workflow patterns discussed in the tutorial: *Agents and Agentic Workflows with LLMs - Complete Tutorial* (see README.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!"

These agents follow the principle of the \"condition-action\" rule, meaning they respond to immediate perceptions with predetermined actions. Reactive agents are typically simpler in design and are effective in environments where quick responses are crucial, and the complexity of decision-making is relatively low. They do not consider the history of past actions or states, which makes them less capable of handling tasks that require understanding or planning over time. Examples of reactive agents include simple robotic systems that perform repetitive tasks or basic chatbots that provide predefined responses to specific user inputs.\n",
